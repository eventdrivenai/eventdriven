Implementation and maintenance of enterprise class software can be challenging even for most mature process-oriented organizations. Our team can provide expert guidance on implementation and integrating with existing ecosystem. We follow a four-step implementation process:

* Assessment
* Pilot
* Implementation
* Ongoing Support & Transition

Our implemantation cycle runs for 8 weeks. Here is our typical implementation plan:

## Assessment (1 week)
+ Evaluate the current landscape and provide fit gap assessment for the product
+ Provide business and technical benefits
+ Tailored demo of the product

## Pilot (2 weeks)
+ Provide a pilot run for identified use cases

## Implementation (5 weeks)
+ Provided tailored implementation for processing events and governing and managing data

## Ongoing Support & Transition (4 weeks)
+ We will continue to work with you after we deliver the product and transition to your support team for ongoing maintenance
